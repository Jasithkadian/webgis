Narration Script for VanDisha FRA Atlas Demo Video:

Welcome to VanDisha FRA Atlas – an AI and GIS powered solution for the Forest Rights Act.

As the app opens, we download a sample FRA claim to demonstrate the system.  
Next, we upload the claim document. Instantly, our OCR and AI pipeline extract the claimant’s details — name, forest division, land use type such as Individual Forest Right, GPS coordinates, and claim status.  
The document preview is clear and structured, removing all confusion.

On the map, the land parcel is plotted as a polygon. Here, for example, the claim belongs to Ramesh Kumar, showing the exact area allocated to him.  
Additional satellite layers, such as vegetation and water bodies, are overlaid to give a complete view.

Now the Decision Support System comes into action.  
Based on the claim and land-use data, the system recommends relevant government schemes:  
92% match for CFR Title under FRA, 85% match for NTFP livelihood support, and 78% match for biodiversity protection incentives.  
Each recommendation is explained clearly, so both officials and families understand the benefits.

With VanDisha, FRA claims become digital, mapped, and actionable.  
For officials, it means faster and more transparent processing.  
For communities, it means dignity, rights, and access to government support.
